So a promise that *resolves* a promise that rejects will\n\t    itself reject, and a promise that *resolves* a promise that fulfills will\n\t    itself fulfill.\n\t  \n\t  \n\t    Basic Usage:\n\t    ------------\n\t  \n\t    ```js\n\t    let promise = new Promise(function(resolve, reject) {\n\t      // on success\n\t      resolve(value);\n\t  \n\t      // on failure\n\t      reject(reason);\n\t    });\n\t  \n\t    promise.then(function(value) {\n\t      // on fulfillment\n\t    }, function(reason) {\n\t      // on rejection\n\t    });\n\t    ```\n\t  \n\t    Advanced Usage:\n\t    ---------------\n\t  \n\t    Promises shine when abstracting away asynchronous interactions such as\n\t    `XMLHttpRequest`s.\n\t  \n\t    ```js\n\t    function getJSON(url) {\n\t      return new Promise(function(resolve, reject){\n\t        let xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();\n\t  \n\t        xhr.open('GET', url);\n\t        xhr.onreadystatechange = handler;\n\t        xhr.responseType = 'json';\n\t        xhr.setRequestHeader('Accept', 'application/json');\n\t        xhr.send();\n\t  \n\t        function handler() {\n\t          if (this.readyState === this.DONE) {\n\t            if (this.status === 200) {\n\t              resolve(this.response);\n\t            } else {\n\t              reject(new Error('getJSON: `' + url + '` failed with status: [' + this.status + ']'));\n\t            }\n\t          }\n\t        };\n\t      });\n\t    }\n\t  \n\t    getJSON('/posts.json').then(function(json) {\n\t      // on fulfillment\n\t    }, function(reason) {\n\t      // on rejection\n\t    });\n\t    ```\n\t  \n\t    Unlike callbacks, promises are great composable primitives.\n\t  \n\t    ```js\n\t    Promise.all([\n\t      getJSON('/posts'),\n\t      getJSON('/comments')\n\t    ]).then(function(values){\n\t      values[0] // => postsJSON\n\t      values[1] // => commentsJSON\n\t  \n\t      return values;\n\t    });\n\t    ```\n\t  \n\t    @class Promise\n\t    @param {function} resolver\n\t    Useful for tooling.\n\t    @constructor\n\t  */\n\t  function Promise(resolver) {\n\t    this[PROMISE_ID] = nextId();\n\t    this._result = this._state = undefined;\n\t    this._subscribers = [];\n\t\n\t    if (noop !== resolver) {\n\t      typeof resolver !== 'function' && needsResolver();\n\t      this instanceof Promise ? initializePromise(this, resolver) : needsNew();\n\t    }\n\t  }\n\t\n\t  Promise.all = all;\n\t  Promise.race = race;\n\t  Promise.resolve = resolve;\n\t  Promise.reject = reject;\n\t  Promise._setScheduler = setScheduler;\n\t  Promise._setAsap = setAsap;\n\t  Promise._asap = asap;\n\t\n\t  Promise.prototype = {\n\t    constructor: Promise,\n\t\n\t    /**\n\t      The primary way of interacting with a promise is through its `then` method,\n\t      which registers callbacks to receive either a promise's eventual value or the\n\t      reason why the promise cannot be fulfilled.\n\t    \n\t      ```js\n\t      findUser().then(function(user){\n\t        // user is available\n\t      }, function(reason){\n\t        // user is unavailable, and you are given the reason why\n\t      });\n\t      ```\n\t    \n\t      Chaining\n\t      --------\n\t    \n\t      The return value of `then` is itself a promise.  This second, 'downstream'\n\t      promise is resolved with the return value of the first promise's fulfillment\n\t      or rejection handler, or rejected if the handler throws an exception.\n\t    \n\t      ```js\n\t      findUser().then(function (user) {\n\t        return user.name;\n\t      }, function (reason) {\n\t        return 'default name';\n\t      }).then(function (userName) {\n\t        // If `findUser` fulfilled, `userName` will be the user's name, otherwise it\n\t        // will be `'default name'`\n\t      });\n\t    \n\t      findUser().then(function (user) {\n\t        throw new Error('Found user, but still unhappy');\n\t      }, function (reason) {\n\t        throw new Error('`findUser` rejected and we're unhappy');\n\t      }).then(function (value) {\n\t        // never reached\n\t      }, function (reason) {\n\t        // if `findUser` fulfilled, `reason` will be 'Found user, but still unhappy'.\n\t        // If `findUser` rejected, `reason` will be '`findUser` rejected and we're unhappy'.\n\t      });\n\t      ```\n\t      If the downstream promise does not specify a rejection handler, rejection reasons will be propagated further downstream.\n\t    \n\t      ```js\n\t      findUser().then(function (user) {\n\t        throw new PedagogicalException('Upstream error');\n\t      }).then(function (value) {\n\t        // never reached\n\t      }).then(function (value) {\n\t        // never reached\n\t      }, function (reason) {\n\t        // The `PedgagocialException` is propagated all the way down to here\n\t      });\n\t      ```\n\t    \n\t      Assimilation\n\t      ------------\n\t    \n\t      Sometimes the value you want to propagate to a downstream promise can only be\n\t      retrieved asynchronously.

The pattern of `SuperClass.call(this)`` only works\\n * when extending other ES5-style classes, and does not propagate `new.target`.\\n *\\n * This shim allows the native HTMLElement constructor to work by generating and\\n * registering a stand-in class instead of the users custom element class. This\\n * stand-in class's constructor has an actual call to super().\\n * `customElements.define()` and `customElements.get()` are both overridden to\\n * hide this stand-in class from users.\\n *\\n * In order to create instance of the user-defined class, rather than the stand\\n * in, the stand-in's constructor swizzles its instances prototype and invokes\\n * the user-defined constructor. When the user-defined constructor is called\\n * directly it creates an instance of the stand-in class to get a real extension\\n * of HTMLElement and returns that.\\n *\\n * There are two important constructors: A patched HTMLElement constructor, and\\n * the StandInElement constructor. They both will be called to create an element\\n * but which is called first depends on whether the browser creates the element\\n * or the user-defined constructor is called directly. The variables\\n * `browserConstruction` and `userConstruction` control the flow between the\\n * two constructors.\\n *\\n * This shim should be better than forcing the polyfill because:\\n *   1. It's smaller\\n *   2. All reaction timings are the same as native (mostly synchronous)\\n *   3. All reaction triggering DOM operations are automatically supported\\n *\\n * There are some restrictions and requirements on ES5 constructors:\\n *   1. All constructors in a inheritance hierarchy must be ES5-style, so that\\n *      they can be called with Function.call().

This is accomplished by changing the property set to this:\n\t *\n\t *    --foo_-_border: 2px solid red;\n\t *    --foo_-_color: initial;\n\t *    --foo_-_background: initial;\n\t *\n\t * This works but introduces one new issue.\n\t * Consider this setup at the point where the `@apply` is used:\n\t *\n\t *    background: orange;\n\t *    @apply --foo;\n\t *\n\t * In this case the background will be unset (initial) rather than the desired\n\t * `orange`. We address this by altering the property set to use a fallback\n\t * value like this:\n\t *\n\t *    color: var(--foo_-_color);\n\t *    background: var(--foo_-_background, orange);\n\t *    border: var(--foo_-_border);\n\t *\n\t * Note that the default is retained in the property set and the `background` is\n\t * the desired `orange`. This leads us to a limitation.\n\t *\n\t * Limitation 1:\n\t\n\t * Only properties in the rule where the `@apply`\n\t * is used are considered as default values.\n\t * If another rule matches the element and sets `background` with\n\t * less specificity than the rule in which `@apply` appears,\n\t * the `background` will not be set.\n\t *\n\t * Limitation 2:\n\t *\n\t * When using Polymer's

The\n\t    primary way of interacting with a promise is through its `then` method, which\n\t    registers callbacks to receive either a promise's eventual value or the reason\n\t    why the promise cannot be fulfilled.\n\t  \n\t    Terminology\n\t    -----------\n\t  \n\t    - `promise` is an object or function with a `then` method whose behavior conforms to this specification.\n\t    - `thenable` is an object or function that defines a `then` method.\n\t    - `value` is any legal JavaScript value (including undefined, a thenable, or a promise).\n\t    - `exception` is a value that is thrown using the throw statement.\n\t    - `reason` is a value that indicates why a promise was rejected.\n\t    - `settled` the final resting state of a promise, fulfilled or rejected.\n\t  \n\t    A promise can be in one of three states: pending, fulfilled, or rejected.\n\t  \n\t    Promises that are fulfilled have a fulfillment value and are in the fulfilled\n\t    state.  Promises that are rejected have a rejection reason and are in the\n\t    rejected state.  A fulfillment value is never a thenable.\n\t  \n\t    Promises can also be said to *resolve* a value.  If this value is also a\n\t    promise, then the original promise's settled state will match the value's\n\t    settled state.  So a promise that *resolves* a promise that rejects will\n\t    itself reject, and a promise that *resolves* a promise that fulfills will\n\t    itself fulfill.\n\t  \n\t  \n\t    Basic Usage:\n\t    ------------\n\t  \n\t    ```js\n\t    let promise = new Promise(function(resolve, reject) {\n\t      // on success\n\t      resolve(value);\n\t  \n\t      // on failure\n\t      reject(reason);\n\t    });\n\t  \n\t    promise.then(function(value) {\n\t      // on fulfillment\n\t    }, function(reason) {\n\t      // on rejection\n\t    });\n\t    ```\n\t  \n\t    Advanced Usage:\n\t    ---------------\n\t  \n\t    Promises shine when abstracting away asynchronous interactions such as\n\t    `XMLHttpRequest`s.\n\t  \n\t    ```js\n\t    function getJSON(url) {\n\t      return new Promise(function(resolve, reject){\n\t        let xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();\n\t  \n\t        xhr.open('GET', url);\n\t        xhr.onreadystatechange = handler;\n\t        xhr.responseType = 'json';\n\t        xhr.setRequestHeader('Accept', 'application/json');\n\t        xhr.send();\n\t  \n\t        function handler() {\n\t          if (this.readyState === this.DONE) {\n\t            if (this.status === 200) {\n\t              resolve(this.response);\n\t            } else {\n\t              reject(new Error('getJSON: `' + url + '` failed with status: [' + this.status + ']'));\n\t            }\n\t          }\n\t        };\n\t      });\n\t    }\n\t  \n\t    getJSON('/posts.json').then(function(json) {\n\t      // on fulfillment\n\t    }, function(reason) {\n\t      // on rejection\n\t    });\n\t    ```\n\t  \n\t    Unlike callbacks, promises are great composable primitives.\n\t  \n\t    ```js\n\t    Promise.all([\n\t      getJSON('/posts'),\n\t      getJSON('/comments')\n\t    ]).then(function(values){\n\t      values[0] // => postsJSON\n\t      values[1] // => commentsJSON\n\t  \n\t      return values;\n\t    });\n\t    ```\n\t  \n\t    @class Promise\n\t    @param {function} resolver\n\t    Useful for tooling.\n\t    @constructor\n\t  */\n\t  function Promise(resolver) {\n\t    this[PROMISE_ID] = nextId();\n\t    this._result = this._state = undefined;\n\t    this._subscribers = [];\n\t\n\t    if (noop !== resolver) {\n\t      typeof resolver !== 'function' && needsResolver();\n\t      this instanceof Promise ? initializePromise(this, resolver) : needsNew();\n\t    }\n\t  }\n\t\n\t  Promise.all = all;\n\t  Promise.race = race;\n\t  Promise.resolve = resolve;\n\t  Promise.reject = reject;\n\t  Promise._setScheduler = setScheduler;\n\t  Promise._setAsap = setAsap;\n\t  Promise._asap = asap;\n\t\n\t  Promise.prototype = {\n\t    constructor: Promise,\n\t\n\t    /**\n\t      The primary way of interacting with a promise is through its `then` method,\n\t      which registers callbacks to receive either a promise's eventual value or the\n\t      reason why the promise cannot be fulfilled.\n\t    \n\t      ```js\n\t      findUser().then(function(user){\n\t        // user is available\n\t      }, function(reason){\n\t        // user is unavailable, and you are given the reason why\n\t      });\n\t      ```\n\t    \n\t      Chaining\n\t      --------\n\t    \n\t      The return value of `then` is itself a promise.

The pattern of `SuperClass.call(this)`` only works\\n * when extending other ES5-style classes, and does not propagate `new.target`.\\n *\\n * This shim allows the native HTMLElement constructor to work by generating and\\n * registering a stand-in class instead of the users custom element class. This\\n * stand-in class's constructor has an actual call to super().\\n * `customElements.define()` and `customElements.get()` are both overridden to\\n * hide this stand-in class from users.\\n *\\n * In order to create instance of the user-defined class, rather than the stand\\n * in, the stand-in's constructor swizzles its instances prototype and invokes\\n * the user-defined constructor. When the user-defined constructor is called\\n * directly it creates an instance of the stand-in class to get a real extension\\n * of HTMLElement and returns that.\\n *\\n * There are two important constructors: A patched HTMLElement constructor, and\\n * the StandInElement constructor. They both will be called to create an element\\n * but which is called first depends on whether the browser creates the element\\n * or the user-defined constructor is called directly. The variables\\n * `browserConstruction` and `userConstruction` control the flow between the\\n * two constructors.\\n *\\n * This shim should be better than forcing the polyfill because:\\n *   1. It's smaller\\n *   2. All reaction timings are the same as native (mostly synchronous)\\n *   3. All reaction triggering DOM operations are automatically supported\\n *\\n * There are some restrictions and requirements on ES5 constructors:\\n *   1. All constructors in a inheritance hierarchy must be ES5-style, so that\\n *      they can be called with Function.call(). This effectively means that the\\n *      whole application must be compiled to ES5.\\n *   2. Constructors must return the value of the emulated super() call. Like\\n *      `return SuperClass.call(this)`\\n *   3. The `this` reference should not be used before the emulated super() call\\n *      just like `this` is illegal to use before super() in ES6.\\n *   4. Constructors should not create other custom elements before the emulated\\n *      super() call. This is the same restriction as with native custom\\n *      elements.\\n *\\n *  Compiling valid class-based custom elements to ES5 will satisfy these\\n *  requirements with the latest version of popular transpilers.\\n */\\n(() => {\\n  'use strict';\\n\\n  const NativeHTMLElement = window.HTMLElement;\\n  const nativeDefine = window.customElements.define;\\n  const nativeGet = window.customElements.get;\\n\\n  /**\\n   * Map of user-provided constructors to tag names.\\n   *\\n   * @type {Map<Function, string>}\\n   */\\n  const tagnameByConstructor = new Map();\\n\\n  /**\\n   * Map of tag names to user-provided constructors.\\n   *\\n   * @type {Map<string, Function>}\\n   */\\n  const constructorByTagname = new Map();\\n\\n\\n  /**\\n   * Whether the constructors are being called by a browser process, ie parsing\\n   * or createElement.\\n   */\\n  let browserConstruction = false;\\n\\n  /**\\n   * Whether the constructors are being called by a user-space process, ie\\n   * calling an element constructor.\\n   */\\n  let userConstruction = false;\\n\\n  window.HTMLElement = function() {\\n    if (!browserConstruction) {\\n      const tagname = tagnameByConstructor.get(this.constructor);\\n      const fakeClass = nativeGet.call(window.customElements, tagname);\\n\\n      // Make sure that the fake constructor doesn't call back to this constructor\\n      userConstruction = true;\\n      const instance = new (fakeClass)();\\n      return instance;\\n    }\\n    // Else do nothing.

This is accomplished by changing the property set to this:\n\t *\n\t *    --foo_-_border: 2px solid red;\n\t *    --foo_-_color: initial;\n\t *    --foo_-_background: initial;\n\t *\n\t * This works but introduces one new issue.\n\t * Consider this setup at the point where the `@apply` is used:\n\t *\n\t *    background: orange;\n\t *    @apply --foo;\n\t *\n\t * In this case the background will be unset (initial) rather than the desired\n\t * `orange`. We address this by altering the property set to use a fallback\n\t * value like this:\n\t *\n\t *    color: var(--foo_-_color);\n\t *    background: var(--foo_-_background, orange);\n\t *    border: var(--foo_-_border);\n\t *\n\t * Note that the default is retained in the property set and the `background` is\n\t * the desired `orange`. This leads us to a limitation.\n\t *\n\t * Limitation 1:\n\t\n\t * Only properties in the rule where the `@apply`\n\t * is used are considered as default values.\n\t * If another rule matches the element and sets `background` with\n\t * less specificity than the rule in which `@apply` appears,\n\t * the `background` will not be set.\n\t *\n\t * Limitation 2:\n\t *\n\t * When using Polymer's
